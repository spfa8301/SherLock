### Abstract:
##### The goal with this project is to be able to detect malicious behavior in smartphones. Cyber network security is a pillar of the project, as setting up a long term solution for looking into smartphone sensor data to detect malicious behavior would simplify the process by which users can see what specific data that their applications are taking without ever gaining root access to the devices involved. By allowing users to see what data is being collected on their smartphones they are able to take control of their own data through increased transparency between companies and users.
